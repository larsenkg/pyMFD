	abstract = {The mechanical deflection of cantilever microbeams is presented as a new technique for testing the mechanical properties of thin films. Single-layer microbeams of Au and SiO2 have been fabricated using conventional silicon micromachining techniques. Typical thickness, width, and length dimensions of the beams are 1.0,20, and 30 μm, respectively. The beams are mechanically deflected by a Nanoindenter, a submicron indentation instrument that continuously monitors load and deflection. Using simple beam theory and the load-deflection data, the Young's moduli and the yield strengths of thin-film materials that comprise the beams are determined. The measured mechanical properties are compared to those obtained by indenting similar thin films supported by their substrate.},

	abstract = {A concise survey of compliant mechanisms-from fundamentals to state-of-the-art applications This volume presents the newest and most effective methods for the analysis and design of compliant mechanisms. It provides a detailed review of compliant mechanisms and includes a wealth of useful design examples for engineers, students, and researchers. Concise chapters guide the reader from simple to more challenging concepts-using examples of increasing complexity-eventually leading to real-world applications for specific types of devices. The author focuses on compliant mechanisms that can be designed using both standard linear beam equations and more advanced pseudo-rigid-body models. He describes a number of special-purpose compliant mechanisms that have use across a wide range of applications and discusses compliant mechanisms in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with several accompanying MEMS examples. Coverage of essential topics in strength of materials, machine design, and kinematics is provided to allow for a self-contained book that requires little additional reference to solve compliant mechanism problems. This information can be used as a refresher on the basics or as resource material for readers from other disciplines currently working in MEMS. Compliant Mechanisms serves as both an introductory text for students and an up-to-date resource for practitioners and researchers. It provides comprehensive, expert coverage of this growing field.},
